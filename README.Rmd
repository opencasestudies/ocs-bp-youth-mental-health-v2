### Title 

Mental Health of American Youth

### Motivation 
Rates of depression appear to have been increasing among American youths since around 2010 according to a recent [report](https://content.apa.org/record/2019-12578-001){target="_blank"}. A [recent study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24285382/){target="_blank"}) also shows that youths appear to be seeking more care from mental health services.

We will explore the rate of self-reported depression among american youths age 12-17 from roughly 2004 to 2018. We will also explore data about the rate at which youths that have experienced depression symptoms are receiving mental health services. We also investigate where youths are receiving care.

### Motivating question

1. How have depression rates in American youth changed since 2004, according to the NSDUH data? How have rates differed between different youth subgroups (age, gender, ethnicity)?
2. Do mental health services appear to be reaching more youths? Again, how have rates differed between different youth subgroups (age, gender, ethnicity)?


### Data   

We will use data from the [National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NSDUHDetailedTabs2018R2/NSDUHDetTabsSect11pe2018.htm){target="_blank"} about the mental health status of youths in the United States of America age 12-17.

This annual survey is conducted by interviewers that go door to door to perform the survey. 

See [here](https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/about_nsduh.html){target="_blank"} for more details about the Survey 
 and [here](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NSDUHDetailedTabs2018R2/NSDUHDetailedTabs2018.pdf){target="_blank"}  for the  2018 NSDUH Survey report.

Importantly, there is no obvious way to download the data directly from this [particular website](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NSDUHDetailedTabs2018R2/NSDUHDetTabsSect11pe2018.htm). Thus, we demonstrate how to scrape the data directly from the website.

#### Learning Objectives

The skills, methods, and concepts that students will be familiar with by the end of this case study are:

<u>**Data Science Learning Objectives:**</u>

1. Scrape data directly from a website (`rvest`)  
2. Subset and filter data (`dplyr`)  
3. Write functions to wrangle data repetitively  
4. Work with character strings (`stringr`)  
5. Reshape data into different formats (`tidyr`)  
6. Create data visualizations (`ggplot2`) with labels (`directlabels`) and facets for different groups  
7. Combine multiple plots (`cowplot`)  
8. Optional: Create an animated gif (`magick`)  

<u>**Statistical Learning Objectives:**</u> 

1. Discuss the impact and of self-reporting bias on survey responses  
2. Define and create a contingency table  
3. Implementation of a chi-squared test for independence  
4. Interpretation of a chi-squared test for independence  


#### Data import 

In this case study particularly covers data import directly from a website using [web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping?oldformat=true){target="_blank"}.

#### Data wrangling

This case study is covers many details about wrangling data from excel files with unusual header structures and with similar data in multiple tables within the same file. This involves using the `stringr` package to split, subset, detect, extract, and modify patterns of text. This also involves using the `tidyr` package to change data shape and using the `dplyr` package to summarize, select, filter, modify, and join data. They case study also covers using various `map_*()` functions of the `purrr` package to perform functions across tibbles within lists and the `across()` function of the `dplyr` package to perform functions across columns of an individual tibble. This case study provides especially diverse material about data wrangling.


#### Data Visualization

In this case study we provide a brief introduction to the `ggplot2` package and provide several examples of using the `directlabels` package to directly add labels to plots. We also demonstrate how to use the `dl.trans()` and `dl.move()` functions. We especially demonstrate how to visualize many overlapping groups longitudinally using direct labels and faceting. We also provide a thorough explanation of how to combine plots using the `cowplot` package. In doing so, we also demonstrate how to modify the layout of a legend using the `guides()` function of the `ggplot2` package.

### Analysis

In this case study we provide an introduction to the [Pearson's chi-squared test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test#:~:text=Pearson's%20chi%2Dsquared%20test%20is,differs%20from%20a%20theoretical%20distribution.){target="_blank"} for independence, as well as [contingency tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table){target="_blank"}. We demonstrate how to manually calculate the ${\chi}^2$ and degrees of freedom, as well as how to implement the test in R using the `chisq.test()` function of the `stats` package. We also discuss how to interpret the results. We perform the test to compare the frequency of individuals reporting a major depressive episode in the past year among two groups across two years.
